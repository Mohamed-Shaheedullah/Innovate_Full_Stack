    Michael Jordan born on February 17, 1963 is considered by many to be the greatest NBA player in history.  He achieved the 'double triple' in the 1990's.  The championships were in 1991-1993 and 1996-1998, all with the Chicago Bulls.  Known for his spectacular dunks and game winning ability, he is 6"6' and played the shooting guard position. He appeared in the popular family film Space Jam in 1996 and more recently was the subject of a well recieved documentary The Last Dance, on Netflix.
